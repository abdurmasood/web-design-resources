## üìù How to Contribute

### Adding New Resources

1. **Check existing resources** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the resource suggestion template** when creating an issue
3. **Follow our formatting guidelines** (see below)
4. **Test all links** before submitting

### Formatting Guidelines

Each resource entry should follow this format:

```markdown

|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| [Resource Name](https://example.com) | Brief description | Free/Paid/Freemium | Additional info |
```

### File Organization

- Place resources in the appropriate category folder
- Use descriptive subcategory files (e.g., `generators.md`, `tools.md`)
- Update the category's main `README.md` with links to subcategories
- Keep descriptions concise but informative

## üè∑Ô∏è Categories and Subcategories
